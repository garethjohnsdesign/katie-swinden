		<p>Season Six was different to previous season in that it focused on one main story throughout and brought in other elements along the way.
The stakes are higher than ever for Adam (Rupert Penry-Jones), Harry (Peter Firth) and the team as growing mistrust between the British, American and Iranian Governments culminates in a season of high-risk operations at home, pushing the Section to its very limits.</p>
<p>As Iran’s race to become a nuclear power impacts on British and American security, the distinction between friend and foe becomes ever more blurred.
A new website called “Spooks Interactive” was created to coincide with the launch of the season. In April 2008, the Spooks production team won the BAFTA Award for Interactivity for their work on Spooks Interactive.</p>
